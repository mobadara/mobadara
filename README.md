## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Data Scientist and AI Enthusiast** with a background in **Physics** and deep interest in how data can transform lives.  
My work bridges science, technology, and social impact — combining technical skills in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Data Visualization** with a passion for making learning and healthcare more accessible.  

I currently serve as an **AI/ML Fellow** at [Tech4Dev’s Developer Foundry](https://developersfoundry.org), where I’m strengthening my skills in deep learning and AI application development.  
Alongside, I mentor medical professionals in **healthcare data analysis** at [Medics In Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medicsintech).
